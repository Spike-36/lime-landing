          YumWords is a simple language-learning app designed to help people recognise and use everyday food words with confidence.
It focuses on practical vocabulary you’re likely to see on menus, packaging, and in real-world dining situations.
The app works entirely offline, so there’s no account setup, tracking, or data collection.
Everything is stored locally on your device.YumWords is intentionally limited in scope, prioritising clarity and usefulness over volume.
Words are presented in a straightforward format to support quick recall and recognition.
The app is designed for travellers, learners, and curious eaters rather than formal study.
There are no ads, subscriptions, or hidden features YumWords aims to stay simple, respectful of user privacy, and easy to use.
Development is ongoing, with a focus on quality and consistency.
