# Hello Blog

This is a test post written in MDX. ack of Prototype Validation: In software development generally, catching issues early through prototypes/pilots saves time and money. This is equally true in legaltech, yet many legal projects go “all-in” on a full build or purchase without a pilot. Experts advocate for rapid prototyping in legal innovation: “It’s preferable for failures to occur during prototyping rather than after releasing the final product.”. Prototyping allows a team to test assumptions and get user feedback with minimal investment. If a concept doesn’t pan out, the loss is limited. Unfortunately, some law firms avoid prototyping – perhaps due to urgency to deliver or lack of prototyping skills – and thus only learn that a solution is unworkable after sinking significant costs. For example, a firm might develop a custom AI tool for contract review but only realize at rollout that the accuracy is inadequate for real-world use. Early-stage proof-of-concepts or pilot programs with a subset of users can surface such issues. As one legal technologist notes, initial user requirements might be unclear, and teams may be tempted to “avoid extensive documentation and opt for quick, makeshift solutions” – which increases the risk of failure if not tested in prototype form. In other words, the first version of anything will have flaws; better to encounter them in a low-stakes prototype than in a high-stakes enterprise launch.
